--- VENDORED FILE. Byte-identical copies live at:
---   bookends.koplugin/calibre_metadata.lua
---   bookshelf.koplugin/lib/calibre_metadata.lua
--- Never edit one without the other. tools/check_token_parity.sh fails on drift.
---
--- Reads Calibre's metadata.calibre and exposes each book's fields by absolute
--- filepath. Extracted from bookshelf's book repository so bookends can share
--- it rather than reimplement it, which matters for one specific reason: both
--- plugins write the calibre.bookshelf.json harvest sidecar, and bookends needs
--- a strict SUBSET of the fields (it has no use for author_sort or the extra
--- series columns). A subset writer would silently clobber bookshelf's richer
--- harvest and break author-sort ordering for anyone running both. Identical
--- code writes an identical file, so either plugin can write it safely.
---
--- Keyed by absolute filepath, so a caller with one open document (bookends)
--- pays no library-scan cost.
---
--- The gate is a PARAMETER, not a settings read: see entryFor below.

-- kept it, every map key became "<root>//<lpath>", and no book's own path ever

-- ─── Calibre metadata.calibre loader ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- Calibre desktop, when syncing books to a device, drops a JSON file
-- ("metadata.calibre" or ".metadata.calibre") at the library root with
-- one entry per book — title, authors, tags, series, series_index, etc.
-- For libraries managed via Calibre this gives us full metadata coverage
-- for every book without waiting on BIM extraction. We parse it lazily
-- and cache the resulting filepath→metadata map, refreshing when the
-- file's mtime changes (Calibre just re-synced) or after a 60s TTL.
-- Forward-declared: the loader below reads CalibreMeta.notify, and the
-- table itself is populated further down.

-- ── calibre.bookshelf.json: our own sidecar KOReader will not touch ─────────
--
-- KOReader's calibre plugin rewrites metadata.calibre after a wireless sync
-- from load_calibre's whitelisted fields, permanently deleting everything
-- else. What survives, measured by running KOReader's own
-- CalibreMetadata:init + cleanUnused over a genuine Calibre file: its
-- used_metadata list only (uuid, lpath, last_modified, size, title, authors,
-- author_sort, tags, series, series_index), every one written as
-- `book[k] or rapidjson.null` - and author_sort arrives as null anyway, its
-- value already dropped by load_calibre. So title_sort, pubdate, publisher,
-- rating, keywords, languages, comments and user_metadata are all gone after
-- a sync, and the keys that remain can be null. So when a
-- calibre-written file passes through here, the two fields with NO other
-- source anywhere -- author_sort (the old wipe, NiLuJe/lua-rapidjson#1 still
-- dormant) and the custom series columns (issue 299) -- are HARVESTED into a
-- sidecar of our own, beside metadata.calibre, keyed by lpath. When a
-- KOReader-rewritten file comes through instead, the harvest is merged back
-- over it. languages and comments are deliberately not harvested: both fall
-- back to the book's own embedded metadata through BIM, so the sidecar stays
-- a few KB instead of duplicating every description in the library.
--
-- WHICH KIND OF FILE is decided by evidence, not mtime: a calibre-written
-- file carries user_metadata or author_sort keys on its entries (calibre
-- writes them for every book once the columns exist); a file where NO entry
-- has either has been through KOReader's plugin. Trusting a calibre-written
-- file wholly is what lets a user genuinely clearing a column see it clear.

    -- WHICH PARSER, and why it matters (issue 299): rapidjson.load_calibre is
    -- KOReader's slimming parser -- fast and memory-light because it KEEPS
    -- ONLY the fields its calibre plugin needs, and user_metadata (where a
    -- Calibre custom series column lives) is not one of them. Verified
    -- empirically: load_calibre drops it, plain load keeps it. So secondary
    -- series need the plain parse -- but a plain parse builds the WHOLE file
    -- as Lua tables, and a big library's metadata.calibre (long comments, one
    -- entry per book) can be tens of MB, which is a real transient spike on a
    -- 256MB Kindle. The gate: plain-parse only under the size cap, slim each
    -- entry immediately to the fields this file actually reads, and above the
    -- cap fall back to load_calibre -- exactly today's behaviour, minus
    -- secondary series.
    --
    -- KNOWN FRAGILITY, the author_sort wipe all over again: KOReader's OWN
    -- calibre plugin loads this file through load_calibre and its
    -- saveBookList() dumps those slimmed tables straight back -- so the first
    -- WIRELESS calibre sync rewrites metadata.calibre without user_metadata,
    -- permanently, and secondary series silently degrade to the primary until
    -- a USB sync regenerates the file. Reading here cannot defend against a
    -- writer elsewhere; the durable fix is upstream, adding user_metadata to
    -- load_calibre's whitelist beside author_sort (NiLuJe/lua-rapidjson#1,
    -- dormant). USB-sync libraries -- where calibre writes the file and the
    -- wireless plugin never does -- are unaffected.
    -- MEASURED, 2026-09-05, so these are not guesses. On a PW5 a plain parse
    -- costs about 100ms per MB and the map it leaves behind is ~0.37x the
    -- file's size, held for as long as the plugin is loaded. The peak is
    -- barely above that (~0.41x): slimming keeps `comments`, which is most of
    -- the bulk, so there is no large transient to fear and little to reclaim.
    --
    -- The old cap was 8MB, justified as "a real transient spike on a 256MB
    -- Kindle". The measurements do not support that: 8MB costs ~3.1MB held and
    -- needed no new pages at all on device, and a PW5 has 485MB. What it did
    -- do was silently drop every custom column for an ordinary library -- 8MB
    -- is only about 2,000 books once a few custom columns are on, because
    -- calibre repeats each column's whole definition on EVERY book (~412
    -- bytes per column per book, measured against calibre's own JsonCodec).
    --
    -- So the cap is now a backstop against the genuinely pathological rather
    -- than a limit on the ordinary: 64MB is ~26MB held and ~6s of parsing, and
    -- past that the slim parser still gives everything except custom columns,
